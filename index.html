          "English mathematician <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"
            target="_blank">Ada Lovelace</a>, the daughter of poet Lord Byron, has been called "the first computer
          programmer" for writing an algorithm for a computing machine in the mid-1800s."
        </blockquote>
        <p id="sticker">
          Around the age of 17, Ada met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>, a
          mathematician and inventor, who became friend, and a mentor to Lovelace.
          Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced mathematics with University of London professor <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan">Augustus de Morgan</a>.</p>
        <p>Being fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Lovelace got a chance to look at the machine before it was even
          finished, and was captivated by it.</p>
        <p>Babbage, known as the father of the computer, he invented the difference engine, which was meant to perform
          mathematical calculations. </p>
        <p>He also created plans for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to handle more complex
          calculations.</p>
        <p>Ada was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by Italian
          engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Federico_Menabrea">Luigi Federico Menabrea</a> for a
          Swiss journal.
          Not only translating the original French text into English but also adding her own thoughts and ideas on the
          machine,
          ending up being three times longer than the original article, published in 1843, in an English science
          journal,
          only with the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace.</p>
        <p>In her notes, Lovelace described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols
          along with numbers.
        <p>
        <p> She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping
          that computer programs use today, offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the article.</p>
        <p> For her work, Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer programmer. </p>
